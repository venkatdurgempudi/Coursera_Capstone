Introduction:
Here we are going to explore 2 of the best cities in Australia, Sydney and Melbourne, and do our analysis based on the venues, clusters and FourSquare API analysis on the maps and decide which is better place to stay.

The approach here is to cluster the SubUrbs based on the top 10 venues in that area and see which city is having more diverse cluster near by. The city with diverse clusters will be picked as the best city to live.

We do visual analsysi on the map using FourSquare API.
